This project wraps your web app at:
https://reborn-fuel-8efcc028.base44.app/

## Quick steps (no terminal required)
1. Upload this folder to a new GitHub repo (via the GitHub website).
2. Go to https://expo.dev → create an account → "Create project" → connect your GitHub repo.
3. In the Expo project dashboard, start an **iOS build** for TestFlight.
4. In App Store Connect, add store listing and screenshots, then submit for review.

If you later have a terminal, you can use:
- `npm start` to preview with Expo Go
- `eas build --platform ios` to build
- `eas submit -p ios --latest` to upload
